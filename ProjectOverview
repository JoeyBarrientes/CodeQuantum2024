# What is CodeQuantum?

CodeQuantumÂ is a free to attend hackathon hosted at UTSA! 
Organized by the ACM-W chapter at UTSA, CodeQuantum is dedicated to creating a safe hacking space for students in the tech field.

Students can also attend workshops, mini events, socials, and network with our industry partners! 
Attendance is **FREE** and all meals, snacks, and drinks are provided. We welcome hackers from all disciplines.

The goal of this 12 hour hackathon was to develop a beginner website or short python game based on a provided base code,
